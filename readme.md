# LaunchMC

A one-click Minecraft launch script. It gives you a file, that you can copy to multiple machines and it downloads Minecraft and all its required files into a single folder, so it can be easily cleaned up. It also prefills in a server IP of your choice, chooses random nick for every player and launches the game. It uses offline (unofficial) accounts, but with an open source launcher, so it should be safe to run. It also does not require admin rights.
